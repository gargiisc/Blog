            <p>
                Looking up at the night sky today I just realized how so far I have come through and how mysterious and
                uncertain life is. How we can be at our home in our little shell and just in seconds we are miles away
                to it. I guess life will never stop surprising me. There was a time when I used to think that everything
                happens because of some reason but now I think that is not how life works. It just happens without any
                conscience; destiny does not drive it. They are just our choices which influence the way our life is
                going.
                Looking back at all my terrible choices all my wrong decisions I couldn't stop but think about how much
                I have failed myself and people's expectations of me. How I have gaslighted myself thinking that
                everything happens for a reason and kept making those dreadful mistakes again and again and I still do.
                I still fucking do it. I still break people's hearts, I still disappoint them, and I still hurt the
                person I love most. But what can I do?
                To be honest I am not seeking sympathy and I also don't deserve it but still, I want someone to
                understand me, someone to accept me for who I am. Is this too much to ask for??
                Whatever life is going to be thrown at me I think I am fine with it now because all I can think is "Isse
                bura aur kya hi hoga" but still I am happy with the life which I am living now "Isse accha bhi aur ky hi
                hoga na" and maybe this feeling of regret is still there in the back of my mind but there is also ray of
                satisfaction in me which doesn't let me fall apart and that's alright.
                Currently, I am reading If We Were Villains and the more I read it more interesting and heartbreaking it
                is...just the way I want. I also realized it has been a long time since I had to beachside I think of
                going there every day but the crowd gets me so I avoid it.
                Bye for now...
                :)
