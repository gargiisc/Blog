                ðŸ™¶It's 1.04 a.m. and I am reading Norwegian Wood by Haruki Murakami for the umpteenth time and it is
                enough.....

                And it is never enough, it is just a start, It's just an overwhelming and sad and deep feeling you get
                after you read this book and all in your head is just the song Norwegian Wood by The Beatles with a shot
                of caffeine and now that is what I want and that is what you should experience and hence here I am.
                Norwegian Wood is a contemporary novel intertwined with love, anticipation, nostalgia, mental health,
                what-ifs and loss. It is set around 1960 in Tokyo, Japan and the story mainly revolves around Toru
                Watanabe who is now an old man and narrating his days back when he was a university student, and we
                navigate through his very complex relationships with two different women Naoko who is emotionally
                fragile and Midori-an unpredictable and radiant. The characters in the story have their own setbacks and
                trauma. and reading experience goes from sometimes very hilarious to very-very deep. The text is somehow
                poetic so every word contains some more meaning to it than we imagine and this is what makes it
                remarkable for me to read it at this time.

                Actually, it is Murakami's style to write poetically and highlight the nuances of human emotions,
                longings, and little things which make us happy sometimes we seem pathetic but it's alright because that
                is what we want and that is what we are. But I really feel sad for Naoko and her struggles not just for
                her but for every character mentioned in the book everyone has their reasons and everyone is fighting
                for something and everything gets blurred after the unexpected turns of events in the last which
                shatters everything and makes us question how unpredictable life is.
                And where it is this longing feeling which we get when nothing happens the way we think; nothing happens
                the way we want and still we manage to find the ray of hope. This is the quote that pictures this more
                clearly:

                ðŸ™¶No truth, no sincerity, no strength, no kindness can cure that sorrow. All we can do is see it through
                to the end and learn something from it, but what we learn will be no help in facing the next sorrow that
                comes to us without warning."
                Overall, Norwegian Wood is not just a novel but an experience, a glimpse of life, the uncertainty of
                things and the fragility of young love. For those who have ever felt lost sometimes to living all by
                themselves, struck in college life and feeling so low this book will just make you feel lower but if you
                are smart enough you will get to know that the simple message behind this book is to simply live in
                whatever your circumstances are whatever you are struggling with get used to it, fight with it and just
                live...
                Bye for now...
                :)
