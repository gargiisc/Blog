      <p>
        This is at the time when I was a little girl back in the two-room rental we used to call home. We had this big
        Sony's speakers which we still have after all this year and my parents were very much fond of listening to music
        from that. So I used to think that the songs I heard were already there all this time, they are not made by
        people but they were already there....all this time. I know this sounds fishy but you just don't know half the
        things I think of they are just more sharky than this. But as I grew up I came to know music was already there
        from all this time it was just humans who were experimenting with it. I was half right I guess.

        I am known for my non-sense intellectuals and I think my so-called friends are quite right about that and they
        had cared enough to not say this on my face but at my back. But those who say it to my face I really like them,
        I adore them. *Funfact: If you want to be my friend just say it..whatever you feel...iykyk* But looking now it
        feels like that life is far away. The way I used to be and the way I am now there are lots of differences now
        some things are good, some things are bad, and some things never changed. I am happy now but not quite happy.
        What do you call it...this feeling? I think bittersweet is right word for this note that sweet is more silent
        than bitter.

        Lately, I am reading this book Cleopatra and Frankenstein, another story I am going to cry and overthink about.
        If I review books I have read in the last months, I am more into sad and tragic endings rather than happy ones.
        I am still not over from the trauma I get after reading Tomorrow 3x and if I really read any book like that I am
        seriously going to be a dead girl. But does it matter if I am alive or dead Anyway my opinion doesn't matter so
        better dead.

        Bye for now :)
